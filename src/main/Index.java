    Foreword

    This is meant as a guide for people who are completely new Java or coding in general.
    This also means, that if you know your stuff, you probably should not refer to this guide
    for 100% correct answers - it's only for noobs.

    There are some simple stuff you need to know in order to get started.
    Java is a programming language that is concurrent, meaning only one thing will run at a time, unless you tell the
    program otherwise. Java is a programming language that is class-based, meaning the structure and behavior of an
    object are defined by a class, which is a definition of all objects of its type, which in turn means that an
    object an instantiation of a certain class with certain attributes, and more objects of same class may be
    instantiated. Finally, Java is a programming language that is Object-oriented, meaning an Object may contain
    data in the form of fields, also known as attributes and code in the form of procedures known as methods.

    Java is very portable, meaning it'll run on almost everything. This is achieved by compiling the Java language
    into an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code.
    In human-speak that means that Java has a compiler which transcodes your code into a language the computer can
    understand and work with. This is not specific for Java, many languages like C# or C++ does this, but the main
    difference is languages like C# compile directly into the machine language it's being run on. This is why C# and c++
    will only run on windows. What makes Java special, is that it compile your code into something called Java bytecode
    which in turn can be read by a virtual machine, written for a specific architecture like Windows, your preferred
    internet browser or your phone, through what is known as a Java Runtime Environment(JRE).

    So in short, one of the positives of Java, is that It'll run on almost anything and because of this, it is
    easy to find solutions to your coding problems online. Java is also really similar to C#, so once you know Java,
    well, it shouldn't be that hard to switch to another language.
